# Refactoring Notes – 2025-08-08

This patch completes critical pieces of the ongoing refactor to restore **feature parity** with the pre-refactor code while preserving the new modular architecture.

## Highlights

- **Napari remains an add‑on**: Introduced `py2flamingo/napari.py` with `NapariFlamingoGui`, a dockable widget that embeds the existing control panel UI and uses a lightweight viewer widget to render images in Napari. No deep coupling to Napari was added.
- **Unified queues/events**: `global_objects.py` now **proxies** to `core/legacy_adapter.py` so there is exactly one source of truth for Queues & Events across the app (and for external integrations).
- **Viewer widget fixes**: `views/widgets/viewer_widget.py` now correctly imports `ViewerInterface` (`..viewer_interface`). It polls `visualize_queue` and `image_queue` and forwards frames into the active viewer.
- **Typos & cleanup**: Renamed `snapshgot_widget.py` → `snapshot_widget.py`.
- **Entry points fixed**: `__main__.py` now imports the correct GUI class name (`GUI` → `Py2FlamingoGUI` alias) and loads the new Napari dock widget in Napari mode.

## What changed (files)

- **Added**: `src/py2flamingo/napari.py`
  - Provides `NapariFlamingoGui` which:
    - Embeds the legacy `GUI` *central widget* into a dockable QWidget.
    - Hides the legacy `image_label` (Napari canvas is used instead).
    - Adds a `ViewerWidget` wired to `NapariViewer`, `image_queue`, and `visualize_queue`.

- **Modified**: `src/py2flamingo/global_objects.py`
  - Now re‑exports *managed* queues/events from `core/legacy_adapter.py`.
  - Prevents accidental creation of duplicate Queue/Event instances.

- **Modified**: `src/py2flamingo/__main__.py`
  - Standalone mode now correctly instantiates the GUI class.
  - Napari mode loads `NapariFlamingoGui` from the new module.

- **Modified**: `src/py2flamingo/views/widgets/viewer_widget.py`
  - Fixed relative import: `..viewer_interface`.

- **Renamed**: `src/py2flamingo/views/widgets/snapshgot_widget.py` → `snapshot_widget.py`

## Behavioral parity considerations

- **External partners (ControlSystem & viewers)**: By proxying global queues/events through the legacy adapter, any external code that imports from `py2flamingo.global_objects` or directly from the package should continue to receive the same objects/signals as before.
- **Cancel/Reset flow**: The GUI still uses `terminate_event` and should behave as before. If you observe that cancellation leaves the app in a bad state, verify that the background threads in `ConnectionManager` and any long‑running controllers explicitly check `terminate_event` and cleanly reset model state and queues. The helper `clear_all_events_queues()` is still available via the legacy adapter.
- **Workflows**: If firmware does not yet accept bundled `send_workflow(...)` commands, prefer sending stepwise commands for parity. The refactor supports either approach in controllers/services.

## Follow‑ups (recommended)

1. **Complete controller conversions** where modules still call legacy functions (e.g., `controllers/locate_sample.py`).
2. **Refactor `GUI` into a pure QWidget** or extract a `ControlPanelWidget` to avoid docking a `QMainWindow` in Napari.
3. **Audit event signaling**: ensure that completion/ready states also raise legacy Events expected by external tools.
4. **Unit tests** for queue/event wiring and for cancel/reset edge cases.
